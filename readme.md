If you are like me fun of prefer using keyboard to operate your Windows system, then here is the right place for you.

The `goal` of MetaKB is described by the below gif:
 
![keyboard](./keyboard.gif)
MetaKB redefined the CapsLock key as a function key:
If you press it, it act like the ESC key;
If you hold it and press other key, it acts like another Ctrl key for you.

> you can press CapsLock+` to toggle between normal CapsLock function and the redefined function key function.


> we use 'CL' to stands for the redefined CapsLock key
